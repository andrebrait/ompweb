// The `OMP_WEB_PASSWORD_HASH` format lives in bin/omp-web-password-hash.js:
// the packaged launcher and the service installers must hash and validate a
// password before Next.js (and this module) exists. This file is the typed
// view of it for the server — never a second implementation.

/**
 * Self-describing scrypt password hash. omp-web only ever stores and compares
 * a hash of the web sign-in password (issue #239): the plaintext used to live
 * in `OMP_WEB_PASSWORD`, which every `omp` child process inherited, so an
 * agent that ran `env` could print it into a session file and off to a model
 * provider.
 *
 * Format: `scrypt$<log2(N)>$<r>$<p>$<salt>$<digest>`
 *   - `log2(N)` (a.k.a. `ln`) instead of the raw cost: N is always a power of
 *     two, and the log keeps the encoded hash short and unambiguous.
 *   - salt and digest are unpadded base64url, salt is 16 bytes, digest 32.
 *
 * Verified with `timingSafeEqual`, so a wrong password cannot be told apart
 * from a right one by timing. The format is parsed strictly and the cost is
 * floored: a hand-written `scrypt$1$8$1$...` must not become an offline
 * brute-force gift for anyone who reads the hash out of `web-service.env`.
