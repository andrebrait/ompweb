 *    behave as if they were running inside the web app.
 *  - omp-web's own secrets. Every `omp` session inherits this environment, so
 *    an agent that runs `env` would otherwise print the web password hash into
 *    its transcript and off to the model provider (issue #239). Only the
 *    *secret* names are removed, not every `OMP_WEB_*`: the update and restart
 *    plumbing (OMP_WEB_PACKAGE_DIR, OMP_WEB_LAUNCHER_PID, ...) is read from the
 *    environment by this same server, and the launcher's non-secret settings
 *    must keep reaching it.
